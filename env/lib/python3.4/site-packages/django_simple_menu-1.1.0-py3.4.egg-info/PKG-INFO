        django-simple-menu is an entirely code based menu system, because, who
        really wants to define their menus in the django admin...
        
        It's simple to use yet provides enough flexibility to provide unlimited
        children menus, per-request generation and checking of menu items, badges,
        and more.
        
        It was built from scratch over the past 3 years as part of an internal
        system after we were not satisifed by all of the existing menu apps.
